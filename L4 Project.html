<h1> Swimming </h1>
<p>Swimming is an individual or team racing sport that requires the use of one's entire body to move through water. The sport takes place in pools or open water.

<h2> The History of this Wonderful Sport!</h2> 
Although humans have been swimming for thousands of years, swimming only became a competitive sport in the early 1800s. Today, swimming is the third most-watched sport in the Olympic Games. In 1875, Matthew Webb ignited public interest in swimming when he became the first person to swim across the English Channel.

<h2> The rules of Swimming. </h2>
	<strong><h4 style="color: Royalblue;"> Freestyle </h4></strong>
	The sport that most swimmers are good at.The only rules are that the swimmer may not push off the bottom of the pool or pull on the lane line, and must touch the far wall with some part of their body. Otherwise, swimmers may use any type of stroke. 
	<strong><h4 style="color: royalblue;"> Backstroke </h4></strong>
	Freestyle on the back.The swimmer must be on their back, facing the sky. When swimmers turn their shoulders more than 90 degrees, they are disqualified from the race for not remaining on their backs. The only exception to this rule applies to the flip turn in multi-lap backstroke races: Swimmers may turn onto their stomachs for one arm pull, provided their arm movement is continuous. When their feet leave the wall, swimmers must be on their backs. 
	<strong><h4 style="color: royalblue;"> Breaststroke </h4></strong>
	Swimmers are not allowed to pull their hands down past their hips, and must keep their elbows in the water when their hands are shooting forward. On the breastroke kick, swimmers must point their toes out to the side as the feet sweep out, around, and back together. For every arm stroke there must be one, and only one, kick.
	 <strong> <h4 style="color: royalblue;"> Butterly </h4> </strong>
	A swimmer’s feet must kick up and down together, ideally with the feet kept close together. While the vast majority of swimmers lift the head and shoulders to breathe, some swimmers breathe to the side, as in freestyle.Butterfly races begin with a forward-facing dive, and swimmers must finish each lap by touching the wall with two hands simultaneously, on the same horizontal plane. At the beginning of each lap, swimmers will do underwater dolphin kicks, but must break the surface of the water with their head at or before 15 meters. In multi-lap races, swimmers will do open turns, as opposed to flip turns.
