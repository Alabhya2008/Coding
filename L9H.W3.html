<blockquote><h1> Vaccine of Covid-19  </h1></blockquote>
<blockquote><p> A vaccine is intended to provide immunity against COVID-19.

In general, vaccines contain weakened or inactive parts of a particular organism that triggers an immune response within the body. This weakened version will not cause the disease in the person receiving the vaccine, but it will prompt their immune system to respond.

Some vaccines require multiple doses, given weeks or months apart. This is sometimes needed to allow for the production of long-lived antibodies and development of memory cells.

In this way, the body is trained to ﬁght the speciﬁc disease-causing organism, building up memory against the pathogen so it can ﬁght it in the future.</p></blockquote>
