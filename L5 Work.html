	<h1> Cinderella by Roald Dahl</h1>
	<p style="direction:rtl;"><q>I guess you think you know this story.</q></p>
<p style="direction:rtl;"><q> You don't. The real one's much more gory.</q></p>
<p style="direction:rtl;">The phoney one, the one you know,<br></p>
<abbr title="Was cooked up years and years ago,"> Cooked </abbr><br>
And made to sound all soft and sappy<br>
just to keep the children happy.<br>
Mind you, they got the first bit right,<br>
The bit where, in the dead of night,<br>
The Ugly Sisters, jewels and all,<br>
Departed for the Palace Ball,<br>
While darling little Cinderella<br>
Was locked up in a slimy cellar,<br>
Where rats who wanted things to eat,<br>
Began to nibble at her feet.<br>

<p><blockquote>She bellowed 'Help!' and 'Let me out!<br>
The Magic Fairy heard her shout.<br>
Appearing in a blaze of light,<br>
She said: 'My dear, are you all right?'<br>
'All right?' cried Cindy .'Can't you see<br>
'I feel as rotten as can be!'<br>
She beat her fist against the wall,<br>
And shouted, 'Get me to the Ball!<br>
'There is a Disco at the Palace!<br>
'The rest have gone and I am jealous!<br>
'I want a dress! I want a coach!<br>
'And earrings and a diamond brooch!<br>
'And silver slippers, two of those!<br>
'And lovely nylon panty hose!<br>
'Done up like that I'll guarantee<br>
'The handsome Prince will fall for me!'<br>
The Fairy said, 'Hang on a tick.'<br>
She gave her wand a mighty flick<br>
And quickly, in no time at all,<br>
Cindy was at the Palace Ball!</blockquote><br></p>
